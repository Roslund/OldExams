# OldExams
To aid students in preparing themselves for exams this repository provides a collection of old exams from MÃ¤lardalen University. This repository is mainly aimed at Computer Science related courses, but old exams from all courses at MDH is welcome.

Please spread the word, recommend this repository to other students.

### Contributing
Contributions are welcome and encouraged. You can contribute by opening a pull request or sending the exams to me by email (`anton.roslund@minit.nu`).

#### Naming Guidelines
The most important part of naming is consistency, and conveying the necessary information. Don't spend too much effort on naming **Just go for it!** The important part is that the exams are available to other students.

Course folders should be named `CourseCode - Full Name of Course`. The full name of the course should be the language the course was given in. If any instance of the course were given in English the full name should be in English.
Exams should be named `CourseCode yyyy-MM-DD [Exam|TEN1|HEM1][-Answers|-Solutions]` and preferably be in PDF format.
